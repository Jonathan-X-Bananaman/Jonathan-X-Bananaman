### Summary of Github Basics
#### Git and Github
- Git is an easy-to-use tool to make and collaborate on code
- Github is the place where we can use Git easily online
  - A repository (Repo) is where your projects are kept
  - Cloning a repo into your computer allows you to work on your projects easily
  - Committing and Pushing is how you add changes from your project to the remote repo
#### Github terms
- **More about repos**:      
  - Repos contain READMEs that describe what your project does                
  - You can use the Github dashboard to easily navigate repos
- **Branches**:
  - Branches are a isolated code split from the main code
  - Branches allow you to fix bugs and experiment with new ideas in a contained area without affecting the main code
  - You can easily merge branches back into the main code when you're finished
- **Forks**:
  - Forks are another way of copying a repo
  - You mainly use forks to copy a repo from someone else
  - Used to contribute to open-source projects
- **Pull requests**:
  - You use pull requests with branches to tell collaborators what you want fixed
  - Pull requests can also be merged into the main code once it's ready
- **Issues**
  - Issues tracks task you want to work on
  - They can help organize work, especially with big projects
- The **user profiles** tells people what you have done with this ```README.md``` page
- **Markdown** is an easy way to stylize your issues/pull requests/files
#### The Github Community
- There are many people and repos on github
- Star repos you want to keep track of
- Follow users you like to see what they are doing
- With Github Explore, you can find many different projects and people to interact with
